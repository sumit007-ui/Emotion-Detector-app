<!-- This is a placeholder for the background video file -->
<!-- In a real implementation, you would place an actual MP4 video file here -->
<!-- For now, we'll use CSS fallback backgrounds -->
<!-- You can add a calming, aesthetic video like ocean waves, clouds, or abstract gradients -->
<!-- Recommended: https://pixabay.com/videos/ or https://www.pexels.com/videos/ for free videos -->
<!-- The video should be optimized for web (H.264 codec, reasonable file size) -->
